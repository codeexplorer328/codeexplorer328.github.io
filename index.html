        I am a high school student who wants to revolutionize the future of medicine by using the power of AI to accelerate drug discovery and development. My dream is to create intelligent systems capable of simulating biological processes and molecular interactions to design pharmaceuticals with speed and accuracy. I have a passion for Biology, Chemistry, and Computer Science. My current research interests lie in applying Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Computational Biology techniques to solve challenges in pharmaceutical research. Some of my personal interests include tennis, table tennis, and Monopoly. I love to play these games and if you ever want to play a set, just let me know. Just please don't cry when you lose.
